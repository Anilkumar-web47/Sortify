# Sorting-Visualizer

A JavaScript web application for visualizing various sorting algorithms. Built for use by developers and educators alike. Implemented algorithms include:

- [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
- [Selection Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
- [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
- [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
- [Heap Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort)
- [Quick Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)

## How to use
Choose an Algorithm: Select any sorting algorithm from the available options.

Set Array Size and Speed: Adjust the array size and animation speed to customize the experience.

Sort: Hit the "Sort" button to watch the algorithm work through the array. You can pause, reset, or choose a new algorithm at any time.

### Built With
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the interface.
JavaScript: Core language for implementing sorting algorithms and visualizations.

### Future Improvements
Additional Algorithms: Implement more sorting algorithms for a comprehensive library.

Performance Metrics: Show time and space complexity for each algorithm during visualization.

Step-by-Step Control: Allow users to step through each iteration of the algorithm.
